        <h3>Swiss Privacy</h3>
        <h4>Data Security and Neutrality</h4>
        <p>
          ProtonMail is incorporated in Switzerland and all our servers are located in Switzerland. This means all user
          data is protected by strict Swiss privacy laws.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>End-to-End Encryption</h3>
        <h4>Automatic Email Security</h4>
        <p>
          We use end-to-end encryption and zero access encryption to secure emails. This means even we cannot decrypt
          and read your emails. As a result, your encrypted emails cannot be shared with third parties.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Anonymous Email</h3>
        <h4>Protect Your Privacy</h4>
        <p>
          No personal information is required to create your secure email account. By default, we do not keep any IP
          logs which can be linked to your anonymous email account. Your privacy comes first.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="row">
      <li>
        <h3>Open Source</h3>
        <h4>Free Secure Email

        </h4>
        <p>
          We believe email privacy should be available to all. That's why our code is open source and basic ProtonMail
          accounts are always free. You can support the service by <a href="">upgrading</a> to a paid account.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Easy to Use</h3>
        <h4>Security without the hassle</h4>
        <p>
          ProtonMail can be used on any device without software install. ProtonMail secure email accounts are fully
          compatible with other email providers. You can send and receive emails normally.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Calendar & Drive</h3>
        <h4>Security with Productivity</h4>
        <p>
          Proton Calendar and Proton Drive extend privacy to your events and documents. Our secure email service is
          fully integrated with an encrypted calendar, enabling you to keep your events private as well.
