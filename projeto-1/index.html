        <h3>Swiss Privacy</h3>
        <h4>Data Security and Neutrality</h4>
        <p>
          ProtonMail is incorporated in Switzerland and all our servers are located in Switzerland. This means all user
          data is protected by strict Swiss privacy laws.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>End-to-End Encryption</h3>
        <h4>Automatic Email Security</h4>
        <p>
          We use end-to-end encryption and zero access encryption to secure emails. This means even we cannot decrypt
          and read your emails. As a result, your encrypted emails cannot be shared with third parties.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Anonymous Email</h3>
        <h4>Protect Your Privacy</h4>
        <p>
          No personal information is required to create your secure email account. By default, we do not keep any IP
          logs which can be linked to your anonymous email account. Your privacy comes first.
        </p>

        <h3>Open Source</h3>
        <h4>Free Secure Email

        </h4>
        <p>
          We believe email privacy should be available to all. That's why our code is open source and basic ProtonMail
          accounts are always free. You can support the service by <a href="">upgrading</a> to a paid account.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Easy to Use</h3>
        <h4>Security without the hassle</h4>
        <p>
          ProtonMail can be used on any device without software install. ProtonMail secure email accounts are fully
          compatible with other email providers. You can send and receive emails normally.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Calendar & Drive</h3>
        <h4>Security with Productivity</h4>
        <p>
          Proton Calendar and Proton Drive extend privacy to your events and documents. Our secure email service is
          fully integrated with an encrypted calendar, enabling you to keep your events private as well.

    <h2>Our story begins where the web was born, at CERN.</h2>
    <h3>We are scientists, engineers, and developers working to protect
      civil liberties online.</h3>

    <p>
      ProtonMail was founded in 2013 by scientists who met at CERN and were drawn together by a shared vision of a more
      secure and private Internet. Since then, ProtonMail has evolved into a global effort to protect civil liberties
      and build a more secure Internet, with team members also hailing from Caltech, Harvard, ETH Zurich and many other
      research institutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, we help our community of millions of users secure their private data online. More than 10,000 supporters
      have assisted us in this mission by donating to make this project possible. Thanks to your support, we are
      continuing to develop state of the art email privacy and security technology from our home base of Geneva,
      Switzerland.
